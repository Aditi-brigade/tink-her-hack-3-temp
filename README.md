### The Problem statement
In today’s world, maintaining good health and fitness is a top priority for many individuals. However, a significant challenge lies in understanding one’s fitness status and getting a personalized workout and nutrition plan without consulting a professional. Most people are unaware of their Body Mass Index (BMI) and its implications for their health. There is a need for an automated solution that can:

1.Calculate BMI based on weight and height. 
2.Classify individuals into different BMI categories (underweight, normal, overweight). 
3.Provide personalized fitness and nutrition advice according to the BMI range.

### The Solution
We propose a website named FITNUR that automatically:

1.Takes Weight and Height Input: Users can input their weight and height. 
2.BMI Calculation: The application calculates the BMI 
3.BMI Classification: The application classifies the BMI into the following categories: 
○ Underweight (BMI < 18.5) 
○ Normal weight (BMI 18.5–24.9)
○ Overweight (BMI>24.9)
